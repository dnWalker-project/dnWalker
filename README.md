# dnWalker
A tool performing concolic execution on a .NET program. The project is based on [MoonWalker](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/tools/moonwalker/), a model checking tool for .NET applications created at Univeristy of Twente. MoonWalker provides the model checking and execution of a .NET program - it basically serves as a .NET runtime executing the IL instructions - a .NET runtime built on top of .NET runtime. The project seems to have been abandonded in 2009. To bring it to the 21st century I removed the Mono dependency and included the incredible `dnLib` library.

## Why?
> Concolic testing (a portmanteau of concrete and symbolic) is a hybrid software verification technique that performs symbolic execution, a classical technique that treats program variables as symbolic variables, along a concrete execution (testing on particular inputs) path. Symbolic execution is used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover or constraint solver based on constraint logic programming to generate new concrete inputs (test cases) with the aim of maximizing code coverage. Its main focus is finding bugs in real-world software, rather than demonstrating program correctness.
